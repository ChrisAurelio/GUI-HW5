This is a basic implementation of Scrabble using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my specific implementation, not all of the features work properly, unfortunately. When the game is started or restarted, the player will receive seven random Scrabble tiles that they can use to create a word on the game board. The board features bonus squares that, if implemented fully, would allow you to get additional points towards your total score. I struggled to implement the score feature of the game, because I could not seem to find a conection between the tile and the square when a tile was dropped. The squares will recognize that a tile was dropped on it by adding a "dropped" class, but I could not find a way to progress further than that during the time I spent on the assignment. I also struggled with the Next Game button functionality. I was unable to remove a tile that has already been used and instead, it would simply revert back to the game deck when the Next Game button was clicked. Because of this, I also could not replace the tiles that were used when the Next Word button was clicked. Overall, the design of the page is complete, but it lacks key functionality that would make it a successful product.
